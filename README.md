Modular arithmetic has numerous applications in:
Cryptography (RSA, Diffie-Hellman, etc.)
Coding theory (error-correcting codes, etc.)
Computer science (hash functions, pseudorandom number generators, etc.)
Number theory (Diophantine equations, etc.)

The python file, may help you do multiple mathematical functions with regards to modular arithemetic. Each algorithms are sub-optimal compared to others
in this space. If you are considering implementing this code for intensive projects, please look  for other scripts.

May the Father, Son, and the Holy Ghost be with you in your endeavours.

Shalom, Shalom
